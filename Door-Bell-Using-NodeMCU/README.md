This is my project which include following components :
1. NodeMCU
2. OEM Vibrator
3. And Some Basic Components(like Breadboard etc).

This Project mainly sends the notification on registered mobile whenever anyone knocks the Vibrator . 

You will need an IFTTT account and the service of Webhooks and Notification as action to send the notification to mobile. 

Whenever anyone hits the Vibrator , the notification will be send to your mobile And then it will wait for sometime then again if anyone hits the vibrator it will send the signal.

Main Purpose to made this project was that if anyone is listening loud music and can;t able to hear the DoorBell , this system will notify him that someone has came to his Door.
